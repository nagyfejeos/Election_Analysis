#                   **Election Audit Analysis**


## **Overview of Election Audit**
In this project a Python script was written to deliver information for an election audit.
The csv-dataset contained the votes cast for a candidate in a given county. 
After importing dependencies, making a connection to the source csv-file, and
establishing a file reader the total votes were counted using a *for-loop*. In the same 
*for-loop* a candidate list was declared and if statement was started to see whether the 
candidate name in the next row was already on the list. Within this *if statement* votes 
were incremented by 1 for each candidate using a dictionary where the key was the candidate's 
name and the value was the vote count. The next *for-loop* was set to iterate through the candidate 
list to calculate the percentage of vote they each received. An *and* logical operator with an if
statement helped to determine the winning vote count and candidate. 
In the challenge part of the project, for loops and conditional statements
with membership and logical operators were used, the same way as for the candidates,
to present the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county 
out of the total count, and the county with the highest voter turnout.

## **Election-Audit Summary**
This code could be used for any elections as long as candidates and geographical regions are 
involved. The code could be simplified to come up with two winners when senators are elected for example.
In this case it would not matter from which counties the votes are coming from only the total 
count and percentage of total count for each candidate.
